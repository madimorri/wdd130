      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>We have made this site to not only to give updates and information about the games we are developing, but to also seek out input and request and questions that you may all have. These games are not only being made for our team, they are for you as well and we hope to include you all in the process and allow you to be part of our team. 

      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>We are seeking those who hope for their children or teenagers to enjoy the elements of computer games we all cherish such as the humor and the visuals, but also for them to have a deeper element of story and different messages for each of our Games that tackle adult themes in a way that will not scare but educate with story driven games instead unlike most other games who tackle these topics.

      <p>
        Hello and welcome to the home page of MORRI GAMES website where we will begin to answer all of your questions.
      </p>
      <P> WHO AND WHAT IS MORRI GAMES?</P>
      <P>
        MORRI GAMES is a single developer who is hoping to develop entertainment not only to have fun and bring joy but to also inform and educate on different topics that haven't been talked about enough in digestible forms for young adults and children.

        I am making this website to help people seeking these story based indie games to find these games that also allow a learning and growing experience along with them.
      </P>
      <p>
        WHAT KIND OF GAMES DOES MORRI GAMES DEVELOP?
      </p>
      <p>
        We have 3 different games developing at the moment, each one being different in their own unique ways.
        The common denominator in our games is that they are story driven and provoke the players to think and encourage them to improve not only lives for themselves but for others as well.
        
        Our games are not yet available to play but we will be continuing updates here and you can find out more about our anticipated release dates in the 'Offers and Dates' page in the navigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        WHY DO THESE GAMES EXIST?
      </p>
      <p>
        As we can all see and feel, the world is becoming a much more chaotic place by the day. As children grow up they are being thrown all of these heavy
        and difficult concepts to understand in a way that is much more than what any child should have to. Topics of loss and grief, illness, survival,
        and much more of these things that we see in day to day lives are things that have become much more frequently talked and explored in these modern days.
        I want to help make ways for them to learn about these topics in a way that can also be a fun and effective learning experience so that hopefully their
        introduction to these things will be more gentle and soft and for those children who have experienced or grown up with these topics that they may be able to
        heal or be comforted even if just by a little bit.
      </p>
      <p>
        HOW CAN WE HELP?
      </p>
      <p>
        Our readers here may be able to contribute to our game development. By reaching out to us and sharing their stories and their experiences with these heavy
         topics that we hope to teach children. Please feel free to reach out to our business e-mail of MORRIGAMES@gmail.com and we will be in contact with you as
         we begin to develop these stories. We want to use your experiences to help develop these stories in a realistic standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of now the email is not set up due to the newer games not being developed yet. We are hoping to develop the 3 that we have started first.

      <h3>Game Selection</h3>
      <p>
        SPROUT
      </p>
        <p>
          Sprout is a game that has been made to delve into the topics of change in our own world, how to survive in dire situations, and about teamwork.
          This game is suitable for those 5 years old and up.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this game there has been a bomb that has gone off in the city you live in. It is your task to survive
          and build you and the team members you find along the way a sustainable way of living. Each team member
          being unique and interesting in their own ways it is for sure that you will grow to love these characters 
          along your adventure together.
        </p>
      <p>
        LUMBER FOREST
      </p>
        <p>
          Lumber Forest is a game that explores grief. This game is suitable for ages 5 and up.
        </p>
        <p>
          As players go through this game is your goal to help all of the creatures you come across in need of help.
          You travel along with your friend Bear and they help protect and provide for you as well. This game shows a bit more of
          how the different stages of grief are shown or how they are processed.
        </p>
      <p>
        HUMAN
      </p>
        <p>
          Human is a game that has a deeper dive into heavier topics in a more upfront way. The game is not gruesome but it holds 
          actual discussion of heavier topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS GAME IS NOT SUITABLE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN
        </p>
        <p>
          This game is suitable for children 14 years old and older.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you play you are working to help people through different stages of their lives and to further understand the complexity
          that each individual holds. While also including the beauty of the world around us and in people in our lives. The balance between
          heavier discussion and humorous moments brings a thoughtful and heartwarming game to the player.
