            <h2>Who and What is MORRI GAMES?</h2>
            <h3>MORRI GAMES is a single developer who is hoping to develop entertainment not only to have fun and bring joy but to also inform and educate on different topics that haven't been talked about enough in digestible forms for young adults and children. I am making this website to help people seeking these story based indie games to find these games that also allow a learning and growing experience along with them.</h3>

            <h2>WHAT KIND OF GAMES DOES MORRI GAMES DEVELOP?</h2>
            <h3>We have 3 different games developing at the moment, each one being different in their own unique ways. The common denominator in our games is that they are story driven and provoke the players to think and encourage them to improve not only lives for themselves but for others as well. Our games are not yet available to play but we will be continuing updates here and you can find out more about our anticipated release dates in the 'Offers and Dates' page in the navigation.</h3>

       <section class="Why">
            <h2>WHY DO THESE GAMES EXIST?</h2>
            <h3>As we can all see and feel, the world is becoming a much more chaotic place by the day. As children grow up they are being thrown all of these heavy and difficult concepts to understand in a way that is much more than what any child should have to. Topics of loss and grief, illness, survival, and much more of these things that we see in day to day lives are things that have become much more frequently talked and explored in these modern days. I want to help make ways for them to learn about these topics in a way that can also be a fun and effective learning experience so that hopefully their introduction to these things will be more gentle and soft and for those children who have experienced or grown up with these topics that they may be able to heal or be comforted even if just by a little bit.</h3>

        <h2>HOW CAN WE HELP?</h2>
        <h3>Our readers here may be able to contribute to our game development. By reaching out to us and sharing their stories and their experiences with these heavy topics that we hope to teach children. Please feel free to reach out to our business e-mail of MORRIGAMES@gmail.com and we will be in contact with you as we begin to develop these stories. We want to use your experiences to help develop these stories in a realistic standard.</h3>
        <h3>As of now the email is not set up due to the newer games not being developed yet. We are hoping to develop the 3 that we have started first.</h3>
